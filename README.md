# Google-Play-Store-Prediction
Overview
This project aims to analyze and gain insights from Google Play Store data, which includes information about apps, their categories, user ratings, downloads, and other metadata. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, this project seeks to uncover trends, identify factors contributing to app success, and provide actionable recommendations for developers and marketers.

Key objectives include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution, relationships, and trends in the dataset.
Feature Correlation: Identify which factors (e.g., app category, size, pricing) affect user ratings and app popularity.
Data Visualization: Create clear and impactful visualizations to communicate findings.
Predictive Modeling (Optional): Build machine learning models to predict app ratings or download counts based on app features.
This project is valuable for app developers, businesses, and analysts aiming to optimize app development and marketing strategies.

Features
The Google Play Store Data Analysis project provides the following functionalities:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handles missing, inconsistent, or erroneous data.
Converts data types (e.g., text to numerical for "Installs," "Size").
Normalizes features such as app size, price, and ratings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzes the distribution of app categories, ratings, and installs.
Studies the relationship between price, app size, category, and user ratings.
Identifies patterns in free vs. paid apps.
Visualization:

Creates bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to showcase trends and correlations.
Visualizes app categories' market share and average ratings.
Generates time-series plots for app updates and reviews (if data includes timestamps).
Predictive Modeling (Optional):

Predicts user ratings or installs based on app features using machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
Evaluates models using metrics like RMSE, R^2, or classification accuracy (for categorical predictions).
Dataset
The project typically uses the Google Play Store Apps Dataset. The dataset includes the following features:

Number of Records: 10,000+ apps.
Columns:
App: Name of the app.
Category: Category of the app (e.g., Games, Productivity).
Rating: Average user rating (1.0 - 5.0).
Reviews: Number of user reviews.
Size: Size of the app (in MB or KB).
Installs: Number of downloads (e.g., 10,000+).
Type: Free or Paid app.
Price: Cost of the app (0 for free apps).
Content Rating: Target audience age group (e.g., Everyone, Teen).
Genres: App genres.
Last Updated: Date of the last update.
Current Ver: Current version of the app.
Android Ver: Minimum Android version required.
